## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-06

Platform sync release (`talimBE-V2/docs/v1.5-platform-sync.md`): one support
system across every Talim app, and version 1.5.0 across the platform.

### Added

- **My tickets** under Settings → Help, on the one ticket system (§1):
  - a list of every ticket the parent raised, about any child, with the
    child's name, status chips (Open, In progress, Waiting on you, Resolved,
    Closed), an unread dot when someone has written, and when each last
    changed; "Load more" for older ones;
  - **New ticket**: the child it is about (the active child by default),
    **My school** (that child's school) or **Talim support**, what it is
    about, a subject (3–140 characters), the message (up to 5,000) and up to
    five files;
  - the **thread**: every message with its files, a reply box with
    attachments, **Reopen** within 7 days of a ticket being resolved (with the
    deadline shown), and **Close ticket** after a confirm step;
  - clear words when the API refuses (409): a closed ticket, a reopen after
    the 7-day window, the 500-message cap. The draft is kept and the ticket
    reloaded.
- A support notification (`{ page: 'support', ticketId }`) opens the ticket's
  thread at `/settings?tab=help&ticket=<id>`; its button reads "Open ticket".
- Notifications gain a **Support** filter and a "Support" tag.
- Dev fixtures answer every `/tickets` route, their 409s included.

### Changed

- Settings → About shows "Version 1.5.0", read from `package.json` (it was a
  fixed "1.0.0").
- The version in `package.json` is now 1.5.0.

### Removed

- "Report a problem" and its `POST /support/tickets` call; tickets replace it.
